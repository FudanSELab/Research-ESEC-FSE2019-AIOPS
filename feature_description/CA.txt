Feature Description:

CA: whether the cache is accessed in the current invocation
Scope: Invocation
Detail description:
    CA means whether the cache is accessed in the current invocation. If the current invocation accesses the cache, such as JVM
cache, it may cause the multi-instance failure. For example, microservice instance A1 uses key "key1" to accesse the cache and 
changes the key from "key1" to "key2". Then if microservice instance A2 still uses "key1" to accesse the cache, it will be failed.
