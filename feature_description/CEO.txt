Feature Description:

CEO: whether the execution order of a pair of asynchronous invocations is consistent with their invocation order
Scope: Invocation
Detail description:
    CEO means whether the execution order of a pair of asynchronous invocations is consistent with their invocation order. For 
example, microservice A invokes the microservice B and C asynchronously, while the request to C is processed earlier than the
request to B, so the CEO is false.
