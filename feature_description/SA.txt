Feature Description:

SA: whether the third party storage (e.g., database) is accessed in the current invocation
Scope: Invocation
Detail description:
    SA means whether the third party storage (e.g., Redis) is accessed in the current invocation. If the current invocation
accesses the Redis, it may cause the multi-instance failure. For example, microservice instance A1 uses id "id1"
to accesse the Redis and changes the id from "id1" to "id2". Then if microservice instance A2 still uses "id1" to accesse 
the Redis, it will be failed.
