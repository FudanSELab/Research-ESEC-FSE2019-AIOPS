Feature Description:

ML: memory limit of the current microservice relative to the node memory limit
Scope: Invocation
Detail description:
    ML is the ratio of the memory limit of the current microservice which is configured in Docker to the node memory limit. For
example, the memory limit of the  current microservice is 1 GB, and the node memory limit is 32 GB, so the ML is 0.03125.
